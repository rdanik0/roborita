### How to commit

1. Clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/rdanik0/roborita.git`

2. Open `dev branch`:\
`git checkout dev`

3. Create a new branch with your feature name:\
`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`

4. Work on the code:\
`git add .`\
`git commit -m "something important bla-bla-bla"`

5. Push the feature after being done:\
`git push origin feature/my-new-feature`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Next steps only if the code is not a experimental feature which shouldn't be added to our main code.

6. Make a **PR-Request** to the `dev branch` on GitHub.

7. Re-check it, and **wait** the others.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not merge the dev branch and the main branch until the code is 100% stable and working.
